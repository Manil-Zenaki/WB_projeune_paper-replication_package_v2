The variables included in the model are selected using a lasso procedure. In both columns, we include cohort and city fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by zone. Due to a low number of clusters (6), we rely on wild bootstrap to compute p-values. The acronym EICT stands for Energy or Information Communication and Technology.
