Robust standard errors in parentheses. \\
*** p\textless{}0.01, ** p\textless{}0.05, * p\textless{}0.1 . \\
Standard errors are clustered by zone. Due to a low number of clusters (6), we rely on wild bootstrap to compute p-values. For each column, we include sociodemographic controls (respondent age, marital status, number of dependent children, proportion of female adults in the household, household wealth index). The acronym EICT stands for Energy or Information Communication and Technology.
