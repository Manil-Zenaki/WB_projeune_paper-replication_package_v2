This table shows the descriptive statistics, i.e., the characteristics of the sample. For each characteristic, we indicate the mean. When the variable is continuous, the standard deviation (SD) is shown in italics below the mean. The acronym EICT stands for Energy or  Information Communication and Technology. Attitudes toward gender roles are measured as the ratio of stereotypes to which the respondent agrees, divided by the number of questions on attitudes toward gender roles. Hence, when the variable attitudes toward gender roles is equal to 1,  the respondent agrees with all stereotypes. Standard errors are clustered by zone. Due to a low number of clusters (6), we rely on wild bootstrap to compute p-values.
