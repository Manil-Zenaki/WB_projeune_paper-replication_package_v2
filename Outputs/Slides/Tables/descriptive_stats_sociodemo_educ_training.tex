This table shows the descriptive statistics, i.e., the characteristics of the sample. For each characteristic, we indicate the mean. When the variable is continuous, the standard deviation (SD) is shown in italics below the mean. The acronym EICT stands for Energy or Information Communication and Technology.Standard errors are clustered by zone. Due to a low number of clusters (6), we rely on wild bootstrap to compute p-values.
